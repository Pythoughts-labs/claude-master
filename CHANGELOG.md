# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude Master are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `/delegate` now asks the user to choose Codex, OpenCode, Pi, or Pythinker when no CLI or agent is named instead of silently defaulting to Codex, and the question documents each lane's model and reasoning controls. GPT-5.6 Sol now defaults to low reasoning.
- Codex lanes now leave long tasks uncapped by default. The isolated runner enforces an explicit positive `CODEX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` only when a timeout binary is available and rejects invalid values before Codex starts. Release validation now reports actionable diagnostics when the Claude Code or Node.js CLI is missing.
- Every implementation lane now uses one shared process-isolation lifecycle through its own CLI-specific adapter. Codex remains uncapped by default; Pi, Pythinker, and OpenCode default to a fail-closed 900-second cap, which their respective `PI_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0`, `PYTHINKER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0`, or `OPENCODE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0` setting disables.
- Harness model, thinking, and variant overrides are optional. When absent, the adapters omit the relevant flags and defer to CLI configuration without a plugin-level default.
- OpenCode project and global installation now package the shared runtime and CLI adapters through `scripts/install-opencode.sh`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- Preserved standard input when the isolated Codex runner starts its process group, restoring the documented prompt-file invocation in both `setsid` and Perl fallback environments.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- Corrected the Claude Code plugin manifest to use a string `repository` URL and removed the unsupported npm-style `bugs` field.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- Routed all delegated Codex work away from the persistent rescue companion and isolated each run from user MCP configuration, preventing completed tasks from accumulating `node_repl` and other MCP worker subprocesses under the Codex app-server.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

Initial public release.

### Added

- `delegate` skill that turns a request into a five-part spec, routes it to a lane, and requires the architect to review the diff before accepting.
- Four implementation lanes: `codex-implementer` (GPT-5.6 Sol via the Codex CLI), `opencode-implementer` (any authenticated OpenCode provider), `pi-implementer` (local open-weight model at zero marginal token cost), and `pythinker-implementer` (autonomous, headless `--yolo`).
- `claude-advisor`, a read-only advisor for commitment-boundary decisions.
- Native OpenCode assets under `.opencode/` and `opencode.json`, so the same lanes and skill work outside Claude Code.
- SVG banner and shields badges for the README.
