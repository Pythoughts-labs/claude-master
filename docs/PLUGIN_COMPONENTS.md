# Plugin Components

This inventory describes the shipped surfaces relevant to marketplace review. The release manifest is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (Claude Architect 0.15.0 at the time of this document), licensed MIT.

## Skill

`skills/delegate/SKILL.md` defines `/claude-architect:delegate`. It instructs Claude to build a versioned Delegation Spec, choose a Producer explicitly, call the MCP lifecycle, review exact frozen bytes, record a human decision, and integrate only an accepted candidate whose manifest hash matches. It recommends `delegatePipeline` for non-trivial changes. If the requested Producer is not eligible, the workflow reports it unavailable instead of substituting another Producer or bypassing confinement. The skill itself is orchestration text; it does not directly receive Bash or file-edit tools.

## Agents

| Component | Purpose and declared restrictions |
|---|---|
| `agents/advisor.md` | Strictly non-mutating advisor. Declares read-only repository tools and no Bash or edit authority. |

Agent frontmatter restrictions constrain Claude Code's advisor wrapper. Implementation Producers run through the validated MCP lifecycle and have only the authority granted by their adapter and eligible OS sandbox. Certification remains specific to the reported Producer, platform, and backend.

## MCP tools

`src/mcp/server.ts` exposes these tools over stdio:

| Tool | Authority |
|---|---|
| `delegate` | Validate one spec, run one isolated Producer attempt, freeze and independently verify a candidate. |
| `delegatePipeline` | Run implementation plus fresh-context correctness/systems review, fix rounds, gates, and clean-room verification. It never accepts or integrates automatically. |
| `reviewCandidate` | Read-only regeneration of the exact anchored patch, changed-path manifest, and evidence. |
| `decideCandidate` | Record accepted/rejected/revision-requested. Acceptance requires a verified candidate; rejection removes its candidate anchor. |
| `integrateCandidate` | Apply an accepted tree only after exact manifest-hash and identity revalidation. Stages changes; does not commit. |
| `doctor` | Read runtime, Git, Producer capability, sandbox, and platform diagnostics. |
| `gitStatus`, `gitDiff`, `gitLog`, `gitChangedFiles` | Bounded, redacted Git reads with external diff/textconv behavior disabled where applicable. They do not mutate the repository. |

The MCP server has no generic command-execution endpoint. Verification execution is reachable only through a validated Delegation Spec.

## Runtime modules

- `src/runtime/attempt-runtime.ts`: lifecycle orchestration, policy, state, and result production.
- `src/producers/*`: Producer discovery, capability reporting, routing, prompt/argv construction, and result parsing.
- `src/platform/*`: executable resolution, process-group/job supervision, checkout locks, process start tokens, and sandbox selection.
- `src/git/worktree-manager.ts` and `candidate-tree.ts`: detached worktrees, change inventory, scope enforcement, candidate Git objects/refs, and manifest hash.
- `src/verify/*`: structural and project verification in a separate worktree.
- `src/pipeline/*`: fresh role invocations, adversarial review/fix reports, consolidation, gates, and final verification.
- `src/runtime/artifact-store.ts`, `run-manifest.ts`, and `recovery-manager.ts`: bounded/redacted archives, provenance hashes, pruning, and crash recovery.
- `src/integrate/controlled-integrator.ts`: locked, hash-gated candidate tree application.
- `runtime/bootstrap.mjs` and `runtime/server.mjs`: packaged executable JavaScript loaded by Claude Code.

## Hooks and scripts

The plugin contains no marketplace/runtime hook declaration under a `hooks/` directory. Repository development uses `.githooks/pre-push`, which is not installed as a Claude Code plugin hook and only runs when a contributor configures Git's `core.hooksPath`. Shell scripts under `scripts/` provide release validation and development/install checks. They may invoke `bash`, timeout/process utilities, Node.js, Git, and test/build commands according to their specific script.

## Tool restriction summary

Implementation Producers may edit only in an isolated worktree and are checked against allowlist/forbidden scope. Pipeline reviewers and verifier are configured read-only with all writes forbidden. The fixer alone receives bounded edit authority. The Host runs only spec-authorized verification commands. Acceptance and integration remain separate MCP calls controlled by the architect/human workflow.
