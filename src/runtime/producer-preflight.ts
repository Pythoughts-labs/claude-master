/**
 * A Producer that cannot resolve the project toolchain cannot verify its own
 * work, and discovers that only after burning the whole attempt window. Probe
 * the executables the spec's verification commands name, inside the Producer's
 * own shell and sandbox, before spending that window.
 *
 * Deliberate limits:
 * - This proves resolution, not configuration. A toolchain that resolves but
 *   cannot load its own config (a `tsc` that finds no `@types`) still passes
 *   here; independent verification remains the backstop for that class.
 * - The Producer is untrusted, so its report is never evidence. The runtime
 *   reads the probe file it wrote rather than believing a summary, and a green
 *   preflight grants the candidate nothing.
 * - Only an unambiguous miss blocks. A false positive costs an entire
 *   delegation, so anything softer proceeds and is recorded as inconclusive.
